A personal collection of Bash scripts I originally wrote to automate and streamline tasks on my own Linux systems. While these scripts weren’t designed with broad distribution in mind, I’ve made them public both to showcase my scripting and automation skills — and because others might find them useful or want to adapt them for their own workflows.

---

## 🌟 Overview
This repository reflects how I approach real-world problems: identify repetitive tasks, script them into reliable solutions, and keep the code simple and adaptable. Each script is self-contained, documented, and easy to modify. Think of this as both a personal toolkit and a demonstration of my ability to write practical, maintainable Bash code.

## 🛠️ Scripts Included
- **installFlatpakAndDnf.sh**  
  Automates installation of a curated set of `dnf` and Flatpak packages for Fedora/Nobara systems.
- **mountMyOneDrive.sh**  
  Mounts a OneDrive remote using `rclone`, with automated status checks and notifications.
- **myLoginScript.sh**  
  Applies an OpenRGB lighting profile and displays a fun fortune message at login.
- **scheduleIcheats.sh**  
  Demonstrates automation of repetitive keyboard input using `xdotool`.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheOnliestMattastic/My-Bash-Toolkit.git
cd My-Bash-Toolkit
```

Make a script executable and run:
```sh
chmod +x script-name.sh
./script-name.sh
```

> Replace `script-name.sh` with the script you want to use.  
> Some scripts require dependencies (e.g., `rclone`, `xdotool`, `OpenRGB`). See script headers for details.

## 💡 Notes
- These scripts were written for my personal setup, so you may need to tweak paths, dependencies, or configurations for your own environment.  
- Contributions, improvements, or forks are welcome.

## 📌 Recruiter’s Note
This repository is not a polished product but a window into how I solve problems with code. Each script began as a solution to a real need on my own system, and together they demonstrate:
- Practical Bash scripting and Linux administration skills  
- The ability to automate repetitive tasks into efficient workflows  
- Clear documentation and maintainable code practices  

If you’re evaluating me as a candidate, this project reflects the same mindset I bring to IT support and system administration roles: resourceful, adaptable, and focused on making technology work smarter.
