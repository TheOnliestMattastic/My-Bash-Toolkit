### üî§ **mooCASE.sh**

[![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shell-Bash-bd93f9?logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge&labelColor=6272a4)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

- **Purpose:** Batch rename directories and files by changing the case of their first character.
- **Summary:** A utility script that converts the first character of directory and file names to lowercase, with support for custom path targeting and filtering options.
- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic case conversion (first character to lowercase)
  - Command-line options for custom paths (`-p`)
  - Filtering by directory (`-d`) or file (`-f`) types
  - Safe operation with verbose output
  - Non-destructive (only renames when changes are needed)
- **Dependencies:** None (uses built-in Bash and standard Unix tools).
- **Use Case:** Quickly standardize file and directory naming conventions across large collections of files, particularly useful for organizing media libraries or codebases with inconsistent naming.

## üöÄ Blasting Off

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Linux distribution (tested on Nobara/Fedora)
- **Shell:** Bash (most Linux distributions include this by default)
- **Permissions:** Ability to run `sudo` for system-level operations

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TheOnliestMattastic/My-Bash-Toolkit.git
   cd My-Bash-Toolkit
   ```

2. **Make scripts executable:**

   ```sh
   # For all scripts at once
   chmod +x scripts/*/*.sh

   # Or for individual scripts
   chmod +x scripts/NEWbara/NEWbara.sh
   chmod +x scripts/mountMyCloudDrives/mountMyCloudDrives.sh
   # ... etc
   ```

3. **Run any script:**

   ```sh
   ./scripts/scriptName/scriptName.sh [options]
   ```

### Script-Specific Setup

Each script includes detailed setup instructions in its header comments. Here are the key requirements:

- **NEWbara.sh:** Requires `dnf`, `flatpak`, `snap`, and `sudo` access
- **mountMyCloudDrives.sh:** Requires `rclone` configured with cloud remotes and `xcowsay`
- **myLoginScript.sh:** Requires `openrgb` and `xcowsay`
- **donTYPE.sh:** Requires `xdotool` for automation
- **mooCASE.sh:** No external dependencies (uses built-in tools)

### Configuration

Most scripts support customization through:

- Command-line options (see `--help` for each script)
- Configuration files (NEWbara.sh supports custom package lists)
- Environment variables
- Direct script editing for personal preferences

## üåï Notes

### Compatibility & Customization

- **Personal Setup:** These scripts were written for my personal Nobara workflow, so you may need to adjust paths, package lists, or configurations for your environment.
- **Linux Focus:** Designed primarily for Linux systems with systemd, DNF, and common package managers. May require adaptation for other distributions.
- **Version Dependencies:** Some scripts depend on specific tool versions (e.g., rclone remotes, OpenRGB profiles).

### Script Architecture

- **Self-Contained:** Each script is designed to be standalone with minimal external dependencies.
- **Error Handling:** Scripts include basic error checking and user feedback.
- **Logging:** Most scripts create timestamped log files for troubleshooting.
- **Non-Destructive:** Scripts avoid overwriting existing configurations without confirmation.

### Security Considerations

- **Sudo Usage:** Some scripts require `sudo` access - review what they're doing before running.
- **Network Operations:** Scripts like NEWbara.sh download packages from repositories.
- **File Permissions:** Scripts may create directories and modify file permissions.

### Contributing

- **Welcome Contributions:** Issues, feature requests, and pull requests are encouraged.
- **Fork Friendly:** Feel free to fork and adapt for your own needs.
- **Documentation:** All scripts include comprehensive header documentation.

### Future Development

- **Modular Design:** Scripts are built to be easily extended or modified.
- **Configuration Files:** Moving toward external configuration files for easier customization.
- **Cross-Platform:** Potential for adaptation to other Unix-like systems.
