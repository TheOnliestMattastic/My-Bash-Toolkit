NAME
    NEWbara.sh - Install packages via DNF, Flatpak, and Snap

SYNOPSIS
    ./NEWbara.sh [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    This script installs a curated set of packages for Nobara systems using DNF, Flatpak, and Snap.
    Flatpaks are installed user-specific by default (as recommended by the Nobara project wiki: https://wiki.nobara-project.org/Flatpak_Installation); use -S for system-wide.
    It can also load custom package lists from text files.

OPTIONS
    -d FILE     Load DNF packages from FILE (one package per line).
    -f FILE     Load Flatpak packages from FILE (one app ID per line).
    -s FILE     Load Snap packages from FILE (one package per line).
    -S          Install Flatpaks system-wide (default is user-specific).
    -n          Dry run: preview actions without making changes.
    -h          Display short reference sheet.
    --help      Display this detailed help message and exit.

EXAMPLES
    ./NEWbara.sh
        Install default packages (user Flatpaks).

    ./NEWbara.sh -S
        Install default packages with system-wide Flatpaks.

    ./NEWbara.sh -f my_flatpaks.txt
        Install default DNF/Snap packages and custom user Flatpaks from my_flatpaks.txt.

    ./NEWbara.sh -d custom_dnf.txt -s custom_snaps.txt -S
        Install custom DNF/Snap packages and default system-wide Flatpaks.

    ./NEWbara.sh -n
        Preview default installations without making changes.

FILES
    Package files should contain one package/app per line, e.g.:
        org.videolan.VLC
        htop
