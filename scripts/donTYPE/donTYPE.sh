#               Automatically binds common in-game commands
#                     to function keys for Schedule I
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script automates binding in-game commands to function keys.
# Run it, switch to your game, and it will handle the setup for you.
#
# How to use this script:
# 1. Ensure you have xdotool installed: `sudo dnf install xdotool`
# 2. Make this script executable: `chmod +x donTYPE.sh`
# 3. Run this script, then quickly switch to the game window within 5 seconds.
# 4. Do not touch the keyboard or mouse while the script is running.
#
# Pro tip:
# - Create a desktop shortcut or alias to run this script quickly.
#
# Note:
# - This script takes about 30 seconds. Ensure your character is in a safe
#   location to avoid interruptions from NPCs.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
